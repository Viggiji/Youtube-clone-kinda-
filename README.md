Learned how to use HTML and CSS through a Youtube video and made this . Never thought i would be able to do such a thing but this is jusst my starting as an engineer 
I Learned HTML and CSS through the video of Channel SuperSimpleDev . It was a pretty good step by step explanation of how to use everthing. 
Heres the link to the video... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc
It took a lot of time Honestly 
I thought it would be done after i watch like 7 to 8 hrs of his video but dammmnn it took me time
Doing it  after seeing him doing it and soo it took atleast atleast 16 hrs, divided into sets of sitting i gave
I have a very loose focus so yeah it can be learned faster but yeah all-an-all a good experience
But i want to now publish it as a website but it takes moneyyyyy...
